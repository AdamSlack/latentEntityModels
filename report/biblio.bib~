               distribution of those dependencies. Since ME models are able to
               flexibly utilize a wide variety of features, the sparse problem
               of training data is efficiently solved. Experiments show that
               the POS tagging error rate is reduced by 54.25\% in close test
               and 40.56\% in open test over the hidden-markov-Model-based

               recognition systems. For continuous HMMs, most smoothing

               propose to smooth the probability density values instead of the

               this sharing to the probability density function (PDF) level, in
               which each PDF becomes a basic unit and can be freely shared

                     thematic structures which provide further insights into
                     the data. The automatic labelling of such topics derived
                     from social media poses however new challenges since
                     topics may characterise novel events happening in the real
                     world. Existing automatic topic labelling approaches which
                     depend on external knowledge sources become less
                     applicable here since relevant articles/concepts of the
                     extracted topics may not exist in external sources. In
                     this paper we propose to address the problem of automatic
                     labelling of latent topics learned from Twitter as a
                     summarisation problem. We introduce a framework which
                     apply summarisation algorithms to generate topic labels.
                     These algorithms are independent of external sources and
                     only rely on the identification of dominant terms in
                     documents related to the latent topic. We compare the
                     efficiency of existing state of the art summarisation
                     algorithms. Our results suggest that summarisation
                     algorithms generate better topic labels which capture

              multidimensional space. This high dimensional data places great
              demands for computing resources. To overcome these problems,
              Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI): a variant of VSM, projects the
              documents into a lower dimensional space, computed via Singular
              Value Decomposition. It is stated in IR literature that LSI model
              is 30\% more effective than classical VSM models. However
              statistical significance tests are required to evaluate the
              reliability of such comparisons. But to the best of our knowledge
              significance of performance of LSI model is not analyzed so far.
              Focus of this paper is to address this issue. We discuss the
              tradeoffs of VSM, GVSM and LSI and empirically evaluate the
              difference in performance on four testing document collections.

                   handle, and their input/output formats. This makes it
                   difficult for a user to select an appropriate NER tool for a
                   specific situation. In this article, we try to answer this
                   question in the context of biographic texts. For this
                   matter, we first constitute a new corpus by annotating
                   Wikipedia articles. We then select publicly available, well
                   known and free for research NER tools for comparison:
                   Stanford NER, Illinois NET, OpenCalais NER WS and Alias-i
                   LingPipe. We apply them to our corpus, assess their
                   performances and compare them. When considering overall
                   performances, a clear hierarchy emerges: Stanford has the
                   best results, followed by LingPipe, Illionois and
                   OpenCalais. However, a more detailed evaluation performed
                   relatively to entity types and article categories highlights
                   the fact their performances are diversely influenced by
                   those factors. This complementarity opens an interesting
                   perspective regarding the combination of these individual
                   tools in order to improve performance.",
