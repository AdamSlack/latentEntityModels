If you just got a

      ! Missing number, treated as zero.

error, then this is part of the same problem.  If not, it means that
LaTeX was expecting a length as an argument and found a number
instead.  The most common cause of this error is writing 0 instead of
something like 0in for a length of zero, in which case typing return
should result in correct output. However, the error can also be caused
by omitting a command argument.
