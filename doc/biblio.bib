                     the data. The automatic labelling of such topics derived
                     from social media poses however new challenges since
                     topics may characterise novel events happening in the real
                     world. Existing automatic topic labelling approaches which
                     depend on external knowledge sources become less
                     applicable here since relevant articles/concepts of the
                     extracted topics may not exist in external sources. In
                     this paper we propose to address the problem of automatic
                     labelling of latent topics learned from Twitter as a
                     summarisation problem. We introduce a framework which

                     These algorithms are independent of external sources and
                     only rely on the identification of dominant terms in
                     documents related to the latent topic. We compare the
                     efficiency of existing state of the art summarisation
                     algorithms. Our results suggest that summarisation
                     algorithms generate better topic labels which capture

              demands for computing resources. To overcome these problems,
              Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI): a variant of VSM, projects the
              documents into a lower dimensional space, computed via Singular
              Value Decomposition. It is stated in IR literature that LSI model

               computing the marginal density of the sample data (marginal
               likelihood) given parameter draws from the posterior
               distribution. Consequently, Bayes factors for model comparisons

               Hitherto, this calculation has proved extremely challenging. Our
               approach exploits the fact that the marginal density can be
               expressed as the prior times the likelihood function over the
               posterior density. This simple identity holds for any parameter
               value. An estimate of the posterior density is shown to be
               available if all complete conditional densities used in the
               Gibbs sampler have closed-form expressions. To improve accuracy,
               the posterior density is estimated at a high density point, and
               the numerical standard error of resulting estimate is derived.

               simulate approximately from a posterior distribution. This
               method is often easy to implement, requiring only an algorithm
               for calculating the maximum likelihood estimator, such as
               iteratively reweighted least squares. In the generic weighting
               scheme, the WLB is first order correct under quite general
               conditions. Inaccuracies can be removed by using the WLB as a
               source of samples in the sampling-importance resampling (SIR)
               algorithm, which also allows incorporation of particular prior
               information. The SIR-adjusted WLB can be a competitive
               alternative to other integration methods in certain models.
               Asymptotic expansions elucidate the second-order properties of
               the WLB, which is a generalization of Rubin's Bayesian
               bootstrap. The calculation of approximate Bayes factors for
               model comparison is also considered. We note that, given a
               sample simulated from the posterior distribution, the required
               marginal likelihood may be simulation consistently estimated by
               the harmonic mean of the associated likelihood values; a
               modification of this estimator that avoids instability is also

                   natural language processing. For this reason, many tools
                   exist to perform this task. Amongst other points, they
                   differ in the processing method they rely upon, the entity
                   types they can detect, the nature of the text they can
                   handle, and their input/output formats. This makes it
                   difficult for a user to select an appropriate NER tool for a
                   specific situation. In this article, we try to answer this
                   question in the context of biographic texts. For this
                   matter, we first constitute a new corpus by annotating
                   Wikipedia articles. We then select publicly available, well
                   known and free for research NER tools for comparison:
                   Stanford NER, Illinois NET, OpenCalais NER WS and Alias-i

                   performances, a clear hierarchy emerges: Stanford has the
                   best results, followed by LingPipe, Illionois and
                   OpenCalais. However, a more detailed evaluation performed
                   relatively to entity types and article categories highlights
                   the fact their performances are diversely influenced by
                   those factors. This complementarity opens an interesting
